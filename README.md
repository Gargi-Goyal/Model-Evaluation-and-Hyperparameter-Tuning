# Model-Evaluation-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning
Training multiple machine learning models and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implementing hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. at last analyzing the results to select the best-performing model.

âœ… **Multiple models which has been trained are:**
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) SVM (Support Vector Machine)
5) KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
